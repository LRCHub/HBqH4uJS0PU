I can't shake this feeling
I can't shake this feeling outta my head
I can't shake this feeling outta my head
I can't shake this feeling outta my head

So remote and hits the bottom
So he sits there
Serious
Pulling me in
Left my name
Systematic, as we sing along

I can't shake this feeling outta my head
I can't shake this feeling outta my head
I can't shake this feeling outta my head
I can't shake this feeling outta my head

I can't shake this feeling outta my head
That something's changed, something's not right
Love magnetic has taken control
Consuming my heart and burning my soul

I can't shake this feeling outta my head
That something's changed, something's not right
A love magnetic has taken control
Consuming my heart from pole to pole

I can't shake this feeling
I can't shake this feeling outta my head
I can't shake this feeling outta my head
I can't shake this feeling outta my head
