Lately been feelin' magnetic, that's nothin' new
('netic, want it, catch it, get it, let it, then forget it, let it go)
Lately they really synthetic, they stick like glue
('thetic, 'thetic, 'thetic, then 'em give me headaches, gotta let it go)

Young [?] son, check me, all 10 toes
One proud mama if y'all didn't know
From the Serengeti, now I run the snow
'Cause my truth on every time I rhyme in the booth strong
Are fake men and some crazy hoes
They mom was probably lazy though
Taught 'em how to get a dollar and be petty when they holla
Whenever he ain't a baller, so we can't be close
Close, chains be close
Pain be close, to hangin' on me brother
Take these flows, I gave these flows
And then I make another
I flick, they peep
I walk with alligators on my feet, nigga no shame
I pimp these [?] with a gold cane
Been in the streets, nigga know 'caine-'caine

Really I be spittin' like a no name
Tell 'em what you write, you really go sane
Everybody runnin' from the evil
And I really does it for the people, ayy
Give me deposit of the whole thing
Shawty need to drop it, I'm the stroke bank
Might not owe a little bit of cheese though
But it's still a dime, got her knees low, ayy, ayy
I'm stickin' to the code
It's frigid to the toes
I'm runnin' outta lovers
I did it for the foes
I did it for the hoes
I did it for my mother
And really I suppose, I didn't really know
I'd meet a lot of brothers
That's livin' in the cold
And heard my lil' flow and now they all a hundred
Now they want the hunnids, but they all guess it's above us
How we got here, now we on the come up
Took a lil butter and I turned it to a honeycomb
That's just the bread and butter
I finally got to utter all my dreams without a stutter
And I did it from the gutter
